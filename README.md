## Description -
Hello human! 
I let you control your phone with simple wave-like gestures. With the combination of accelerometer and proximity sensors, I can answer calls, silent your phone and even end calls. You can customize these options in me according to your needs. You can select different functions to be performed on single wave as well as on double wave. I can also turn the speaker on or off according to whether it is held close or away from the ear during a call which will only work after putting on ear at least once (to protect privacy). You can add sensitive contacts to blacklist so that this function does not work and prevent some pretty embarrassing situations! You can also decide whether to silent the phone when it is picked up from a flat surface. You can end call or mute microphone if phone is kept facing down on a flat surface. Install me and rate me or drop a review to support my dev-human (my god, the omnipresent).

Features:
1. Single wave- Waving hand over the proximity sensor once
2. Double wave- Two simultaneous waves with a time difference of less than 1.2 seconds (by default but, can be changed). Basically, a usual casual "bye-bye" over the phones' proximity sensor.
3. Silent on picking up the phone from flat surface.
4. During a call, the speaker will turn on when phone is moved away from ear and will turn off when brought back to it. You can even add sensitive contacts to blacklist!
5. Automatically end calls or mute microphone when phone is kept facing down during a call!
6. Do not worry about missing your calls when phone is in pocket. I am smart enough to tell that. Your calls are safe with me.
7. All features are pretty smart. for example, automatic speaker toggle does not work till phone is kept on ear at least once or you are using a headset (wired or bluetooth ).
8. Nougat quick-cuts!!!
9. My dev-human is a nice guy.
10. Ad free. Forever! :)


Very Very important:
Please wave your hand over the proximity sensor and not over the screen because that is what I can detect. The proximity sensor is generally located near the front camera of the phone. This sensor detects if an object is present in front of it or not. This means, all the gestures will also work with something 'non-hand' like a book or a table (that is if you can lift a table and wave it over your phone).

Note:
I work perfectly on devices with near stock ROM. My dev-human is working really hard to bring compatibility to all other devices. For Xiaomi devices, you can lock me in the RAM (in recents), so that I can work well for you. Rest assured, I consume negligible RAM and battery.
